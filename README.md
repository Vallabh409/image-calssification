# 🐟 Multiclass Fish Image Classification

This project focuses on classifying various species of fish using deep learning techniques. A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and multiple pre-trained models (such as MobileNet, VGG16, etc.) were evaluated to identify the most accurate model for deployment.

---

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- ✅ Image classification for 11 fish species.
- ✅ Models trained and evaluated: CNN, MobileNet, VGG16, ResNet50.
- ✅ Best performing model (MobileNet) achieved **99.63% accuracy**.
- ✅ Deployed using **Streamlit** for real-time fish species prediction.
- ✅ .h5 model file hosted via Google Drive for easy integration.
